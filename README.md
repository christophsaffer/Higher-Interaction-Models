# Package for Multivariate Binary Models of Higher Interaction Orders

Clone the repository and execute the introducing script to fit a model of interaction order 2

```
  ./fit_model_order2_script.py
```

or to fit a model of interaction order 3

```
  ./fit_model_order3_script.py
```

To understand the theory behind, read the .pdf file in DOC/.

An application can be seen in the directory spamfilter/ where model is trained to classify emails as spam or not spam.
